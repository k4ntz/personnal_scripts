# personnal_scripts
Useful scripts to configure a machine

### configure_zsh
Install zsh, oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k (with useful addons). 
It uses .zshrc and .p10k.zsh as config file

### get_processes
Use rtpt class in your Deep Learning classes to rename the process name and have a personalize process name, also giving estimated the remaining time.
Then get_processes will connect on all the servers you reference in .server_list.txt 
and run nvidia-smi to get these process names and retrieve the ones you own.
